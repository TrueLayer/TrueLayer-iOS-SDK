# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. To know better on how to write and maintain a changelog, refer to [this link](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [3.0.0] - Horizon

### Added
- `shouldShowResultScreen` to `SinglePayment` and `Mandate` `Preferences` objects (default value is `true`). When this is enabled, a result screen is displayed at the end of the payment flow. When the user is redirected back from the bank, it is recommended to re-invoke the TrueLayer SDK to display the result screen, to show the user the status of their payment or mandate.
- `maximumResultScreenTimeout` to `SinglePayment` and `Mandate` `Preferences` objects. This is the maximum timeout for the payment or mandate result screen, until a final status. Once reached, the user is shown a button to dismiss the SDK and return to your app.
- Italian localisations for text displayed to the user.

### Changed
- Updated `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.Mandate.Error` and `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.SinglePayment.Error` cases. These more accurately match errors received from the TrueLayer Payments API V3.
- Merchant logo now appears on the right on the consent screen.

### Removed

- `useCase` from `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.SinglePayment.Preferences`. To enable Signup+ for a payment, refer to the API documentation when creating a payment.

## [2.7.1] - Tusk

### Fixed

- Removed requirement for thread locking to prevent possible crashes related to a semaphore not releasing in time during de-initialisation.
- Fixed some screens being retained after the payment processing is completed.

### Added

- Saved accounts selection and removal, for future users who decide to save their account with TrueLayer.
- Recently used providers are combined into the same section as other providers on the provider selection list.
- Possibility for the user to select the SEPA scheme when applicable. To enable it set `scheme_selection` is set to `user_selected` when creating the payment. Please refer to the [Create Payment](https://docs.truelayer.com/reference/create-payment) documentation for more information.
- Refinements to the user interface design.

- New error cases:
  - `invalidRedirectURI` error case to `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.Mandate.Error` and `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.SinglePayment.Error`.
  - `providerOffline` error case to `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.Mandate.Error` and `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.SinglePayment.Error`. It will be thrown only if the provider is pre-selected.
- PISP license holders who are processing payments under their certificates can now choose to remove TrueLayer branding from the user interface. Contact us to enquire about enabling this feature.

### Removed

This new release focuses on polishing what was built with `1.0.0`, and fixing minor visual bugs specifically in the country selection. In addition it introduces support for 2 new features: cancel payment, and IBAN additional input.

ATTENTION: This minor update contains necessary breaking fixes. However, we opted for a minor change because those breaking changes are rather irrelevant and should not impact already integrated SDKs.
