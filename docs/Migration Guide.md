# TrueLayer iOS SDK Migration Guide

## Migrating from 2.x to 3.x

### Configuring the SDK

Previously:

```
TrueLayer.Payments.manager.configure(environment: .sandbox)
```

Now:

```
await TrueLayer.Payments.manager.configure(environment: .sandbox)
```

### Result Screen

In the `Preferences` object, `shouldShowResultScreen` is set to `true` by default. This tells the TrueLayer SDK to display the result of a payment or mandate at the end of the authorization flow. This screen automatically refreshes until the payment is creditable, or until a maximum timeout is reached (customizable by setting `maximumResultScreenTimeout`). By default this timeout is 10 seconds, and cannot be set longer (the SDK will use 10s if you pass a greater value).

It is recommended to re-invoke `processSinglePayment` or `processMandate` once the user is re-directed from their bank back to your application. Some banks require further input from the user, which the SDK can display. If there are no further inputs required, the SDK will either return a payment result to your app (`shouldShowResultScreen` is `false`), or show a result screen (`shouldShowResultScreen` is `true`).

### Failure Reasons

There are more failure reasons to handle in 3.0.0. Please see [DOCUMENTATION](../DOCUMENTATION.md) for a list of available reasons.

## Migrating from 1.x to 2.x

Xcode will suggest changes for objects that have modified namespaces and methods. For other changes, please see the steps below.

##### Processing a Single Payment

Previously:

```
TrueLayer.Payments.manager.processPayment(
  context: TrueLayer.Payments.Models.Payment.Context(
    paymentIdentifier: // Your payment ID,
    resourceToken: // Your resource token,
    redirectURL: // Your redirect URL,
    presentationStyle: .present(on: yourViewController, style: .automatic)
  )) { result in
    switch result {
      case .success(let authorizationFlowResult):
        // Handle `AuthorizationFlowResult`. See below for the new handling logic.

      case .failure(let error):
        // Handle error. See below for the new handling logic.
    }
}
```

Now:

```
TrueLayer.Payments.manager.processSinglePayment(
  context: TrueLayer.Payments.Models.SinglePayment.Context(
    identifier: // Your payment ID,
    token: // Your resource token,
    redirectURL: // Your redirect URL,
    preferences: TrueLayer.Payments.Models.SinglePayment.Preferences(
        presentationStyle: .present(on: yourViewController, style: .automatic)
      )
  )) { result in
    switch result {
      case .success(let authorizationFlowResult):
        // Handle `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.SinglePayment.State`.

      case .failure(let error):
        // Handle `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.SinglePayment.Error`.
    }
}
```

##### Retrieving a Single Payment Status

Previously:

```
TrueLayer.Payments.manager.paymentStatus(paymentIdentifier: paymentIdentifier, resourceToken: resourceToken)
```

Now:

```
TrueLayer.Payments.manager.singlePaymentStatus(paymentIdentifier: paymentIdentifier, resourceToken: resourceToken)
```

There are also type changes, with the underlying properties remaining the same:

| Previously | Now |
| ------------- | ------------- 
| `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.Payment.Context` | `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.SinglePayment.Context`
| `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.Payment.Preferences` | `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.SinglePayment.Preferences`
| `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.Payment.Status` | `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.SinglePayment.Status`
| `TrueLayer.Payments.PaymentState` | `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.SinglePayment.State`
| `TrueLayer.Payments.Error` | `TrueLayer.Payments.Models.SinglePayment.Error`

## Migrating from beta to 2.x

### Import the TrueLayer iOS SDK

Previously:

```
import TrueLayerPaymentsSDK
```

Now:

```
import TrueLayerSDK
```

###  Configure the SDK

Previously:

```
do {
  try TrueLayerPayments.Manager.shared.start(environment: .sandbox)
} catch {
  print(error)
  fatalError()
}    
```
    
Now:

```
TrueLayer.Payments.manager.configure(environment: .sandbox)
```
### Process Payment
Previously:

```
do {
  try TrueLayerPayments.Manager.shared.processPayment(
    context: .init(
      paymentId: // Your payment ID,
      resourceToken: // Your resource token,
      endOfFlowRedirectURI: // Your redirect URL,
      presentationStyle: .present(on: self, modalPresentationStyle: .automatic)
    ),
    callback: { result in
      switch result {
      case .success(let step):
        // Handle step
        
      case .failure(let error):
        // Handle error
      }
    })
} catch {
  // Handle error
}
```

Now:

```
TrueLayer.Payments.manager.processSinglePayment(
  context: TrueLayer.Payments.Models.SinglePayment.Context(
    identifier: // Your payment ID,
    token: // Your resource token,
    redirectURL: // Your redirect URL,
    preferences: TrueLayer.Payments.Models.SinglePayment.Preferences(
        presentationStyle: .present(on: yourViewController, style: .automatic)
      )
  )) { result in
    switch result {
      case .success(let authorizationFlowResult):
        // Handle `AuthorizationFlowResult`. See below for the new handling logic.

      case .failure(let error):
        // Handle error. See below for the new handling logic.
    }
}
```

#### Preferences

The preferences object type has changed, however the implementation remains the same.

Previously:

```
TrueLayer.Payments.Models.Payment.Context(preferredCountryCode: "GB")
```

Now:

```
TrueLayer.Payments.Models.SinglePayment.Preferences(preferredCountryCode: "GB")
```


### Handling the Result
